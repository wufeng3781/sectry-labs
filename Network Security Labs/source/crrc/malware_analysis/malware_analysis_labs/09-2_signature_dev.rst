Signature Development
*********************

Overview
--------

The goal of this lab is to write your own custom rules based off of the
PCAPS provided. Keep the following in mind:

-  Rules can be somewhat subjective, focus on writing signatures that
   minimize false-positives.

-  Try to be precise with your rules but keep in mind that there may be
   a performance impact depending on how you write them. While this lab
   does NOT focus on performance, this is a significant factor if
   writing and using rules on real systems.

-  You will only be testing your signatures against the PCAPs provided.
   However, if you were writing these for a production system, you would
   want to test on a non-production sensor or large PCAPs of your
   organizationâ€™s traffic.

**Sample 1**

Word-Dropper.pcap

Create a signature that will match on the HTTP requests in frames 3434
and 3437 (client -> server).

**Sample 2**

CryptoLocker.pcap

Create a signature, using flowbits, that will match on the request and
response starting at frame 813 (follow HTTP stream to see the
request/response). Alert on the response in frame 817.

**Sample 3**

Goboti.pcap

Create a signature that will alert on the response that contains a PE
file. Similar to sample 2, this should be two rules, one to match on the
request, the other to match (and alert) on the response. Use flowbits to
control this sequence.

**Sample 4**

Angler-EK.pcap

Create a signature to detect the landing page from the Angler EK.

**Deliverables**

Turn in a Word document or PDF with a screenshot of each rule you
created along with the alert it generates when using with Suricata.
