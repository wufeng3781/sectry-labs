Finding Hashes & Strings
========================

Overview
--------

**Lab Description:** The goal of this lab is to provide an application
of the basic static analysis techniques and tools discussed in the
lecture. Basic static analysis allows you to identify malicious files,
begin to understand it’s behavior and share threat information.

**Lab Environment:** You can utilize the VM environment from the lesson,
“Creating a Safe Lab Environment”. In addition, the REMnux Linux
distribution (https://remnux.org/) may also be used, this Linux
distribution comes pre-configured with many of the tools needed for this
lab. Or you can access EZSetup dashboard and view your **Malware
Analysis** lab. REMnux VM has been deployed on the cloud environment.

**Lab Files that are Needed:** The files required will be provided in
the accompanying archive, 02_BasicStaticAnalysis.zip. The archive is
password protected with the password: ``infected``

Lab Exercise 1:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the following sample, ``keylogger.exe``, answer these questions.
Each question should include a screenshot, and brief explanation of it.

1. Using a strings utility such as strings from a command line or the
   strings window in IDA Pro; what strings can you find that you think
   are relevant?

2. Using a hashing utility, create an MD5 hash of the program, what is
   the hash value? Use this hash to find additional information about
   the sample on VirusTotal, what are the results?

3. Now create a SHA256 and SHA512 hash, what are they?

LAB EXERCISE 2:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This exercise will utilize the REMnux VM found at https://remnux.org and
require you to create custom Clam-AV signatures.

1. Create an ASCII-based signature based off of a custom program that
   you create. Show the results of scanning your custom program with
   Clam-AV from a terminal, the results should clearly demonstrate that
   Clam-AV identifies your sample program as malicious.

What to submit 
--------------

Submit a Microsoft Word document or PDF that includes answers to the
questions posed along with screenshots supporting your answers.
