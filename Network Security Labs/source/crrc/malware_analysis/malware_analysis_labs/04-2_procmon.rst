Use *CryptoLocker.txt* & *CryptoLocker.PML*.  The TXT file is a capture
of process activity at the time of the infection, the .PML is a log from
Process Monitor during the same attack.  

 

1. Identify the malicious process, what is its process ID (PID)?

2. What process started this process?

3. Describe the process activity for the malware.  

4. Did the malware modify any registry keys? If so, what is the
