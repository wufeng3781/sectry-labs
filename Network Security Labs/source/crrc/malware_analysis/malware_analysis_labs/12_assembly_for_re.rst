***************************************************
Reverse Engineering: Assembly For Reverse Engineers
***************************************************

Overview
--------

**Lab Description:** In this lab you will be reverse engineering a
binary to create a functional equivalent C++ program.

**Lab Environment:** The target program was compiled to run on a Windows
Operating System. This file is not malicious; however, it is recommended
to perform your analysis in your lab environment. In addition to a
Windows OS, the following tools are also required:

-  IDA Pro (demo/free) by Hex-Rays

**Lab Files that are Needed:** You will be reverse engineering the lab
file â€“ :download:`Binary.bin<media/12_assembly_for_re/binary.bin>`

Instructions
------------

This lab uses arguments, loops, arrays, math and advanced C functions.
You will learn how these functions work if you have not seen them
before. You will then try and recover the source code for this program,
by recreating it. Do not use inline assembly.

**Things to Do**

-  Comment your IDA database as appropriate, this will help you build a
   better picture of what the program is doing.

-  Identify all control and data structures. Determine how large you
   think they are.

-  Use your work in IDA to help you recreate the source code for the
   file.

-  This program uses three standard structures - make sure you identify
   their use.

What to submit 
--------------

Submit a Microsoft Word document or PDF with your lab report.
