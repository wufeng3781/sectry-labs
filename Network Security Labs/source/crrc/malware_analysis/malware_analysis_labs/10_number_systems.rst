***********************************
Reverse Engineering: Number Systems
***********************************

Overview
--------


**Lab Description:** The ability to convert between different number
systems is an essential skill for any reverse engineer. In this lab, you
will apply the knowledge you have gained in converting between base 2,
10 and 16 number systems. In addition, you will be applying your
knowledge of signed magnitude, one’s complement and two’s complement.

**Lab Environment:** This lab is designed to be completed by hand and no
lab environment is needed. Avoid the use of a calculator, as you must
demonstrate your ability to perform the conversions.

**Lab Files that are Needed:** No additional files are needed for this
lab.
