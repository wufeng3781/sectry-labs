Lab 1 - Designing an IR Plan
****************************

In this lab you will create a short incident response plan. There are a
lot of different pieces that will go into this puzzle. Capture as many
of them as you can as concisely as you can. You can either use an
organization that you currently work for or make one up and decide how
your plan will best fit the needs of that organization.

At a minimum your plan should include the following:

1. Describe the organization and its mission

2. State the goal of the incident response plan

3. Define the IR roles, who is involved?

4. Define the processes

5. Reference the steps needed to complete the incident response

6. Describe the communication channels

If you believe that there should be another document, policy, procedure,
etc. that your overall plan references you may do that. We have not yet
covered many of the steps followed in incident response. Those steps
should be referenced as other documents. We will come back and create
some of those later.
