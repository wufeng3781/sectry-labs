Lab 2 - Continued Planning
**************************

Weâ€™ve covered the rest of the high-level steps to complete an incident
response. These are broad strokes ideas of how to address the rest of
the steps involved in IR. Some of these areas may be very short.

Address the following steps:

1. Identification

2. Containment

3. Eradication

4. Recovery

5. Lessons Learned

Remember to address them in the context of the organization you
described in the original incident response plan document. You can go
back and modify that document to make these new steps flow better if
needed but that is not required.

Steps down here....
