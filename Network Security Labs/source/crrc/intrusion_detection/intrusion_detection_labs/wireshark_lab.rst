In this lab, you will use Wireshark to search through a traffic capture
and derive conclusions about the packets that are captured. A pcap file
is provided that contains the specific traffic capture for the lab. You
can verify that you have the correct file by going to ``Statistics`` >
``Capture File Properties`` and verifying that there are 16133 packets
captured. 

Answer the following questions below with both the answer AND a
screenshot showing your search and how you got your results. 

1.  What is the IP address of the client in the capture?

2.  What is the operating system of the client in the capture?

3.  What is the username/password to the FTP server?

4.  Find the image that was transferred over and export it.

5.  There was an error browsing a particular website. What was the URL and the error?

6.  The user visited 3 websites, what were they (remember, other sites may have had requests, what sites did the user specifically go to)?

7.  There was a DNS request for an MX record; what was it?

8.  A request is made to “something”. msftncsi.com -> what is this for?

9.  What “hardware” was the machine involved in this capture running on?

10. There’s a file transferred over HTTP called “success.txt”. Where is  it from, what are its contents, and what is its purpose?
