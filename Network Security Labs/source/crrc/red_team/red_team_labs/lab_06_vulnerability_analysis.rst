Lab 6 - Vulnerability Analysis
==============================

Overview 
--------

We’ll take scanning to a deeper level this week and look at what is
running on the ports. This time you’ll be dropped into a Kali machine
that is connected to a network that you haven’t seen before and have no
OSINT for. Your rules of engagement for this operation do not allow you
to scan anything outside of the target network. Pay close attention to
the subnet mask of the network and do not operate outside of the rules
of engagement. If you would like to use nmap to complement the below
scripts you may also do that.

**Target Network: 10.10.15.0/24**

.. important:: DO NOT EXPLOIT OR MODIFY ANY OF THE TARGETS

Task 1
------

Configure and run Openvas vulnerability scanner on the target network

Task 2
------

Find and run at least 2 nmap NSE scripts against likely targets of
compromise.

Task 3
------

Once you have run the previous scans, run Nikto and report the results

Summarize your results and present the most significant findings with
OS’s, ports open, and vulnerabilities.
