Lab 2 - Statement of Work 
=========================
--------
Overview 
--------

Write a short Statement of Work for the company XYZCorp for the test you
are about to conduct. Review the video or check out:
`<http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Pre-engagement#Introduction_to_Scope>`_
for items you may want to cover. For any of the details pertinent to the
test such as addressing, timelines, costs, contact information, etc.
feel free to make them up as you go. The details in the video are not
comprehensive so you can add other details not previously mentioned to
your SoW. There is no page length requirement but make sure to write
enough to thoroughly create the statement of work.

The document produced should look like a professional document

The document should at a minimum have the following:

-  Executive Summary

-  Test goals

-  Schedule

-  Scope

-  Addressing

-  Costs/Payment Schedule

-  Contact information

-  Reporting Schedule

-  Communications Policy

-  Signatory page
