====================
Lab 12 - Persistence
====================

Overview 
=========

Once you have gained access to a system you may want to be able to gain
access later. There are many options when it comes to installing
persistence on a target. Running “search persist” from msfconsole will
show you many of the options that are available to you. To learn more
about a specific persistence mechanism remember to reference the
msfconsole info command.

Use the IA Lab Pivot vApp for this lab and install persistence methods
on the Windows XP and Linux host. Use screenshots to show your work.

Use an option from the exploit/windows/local/ directory in Metasploit on
the XP host. Explain how it works.

Persistence 2
-------------

Use an option from the exploit/linux/local/ directory in Metasploit on
the Linux host. Explain how it works

Persistence 3

it works.
