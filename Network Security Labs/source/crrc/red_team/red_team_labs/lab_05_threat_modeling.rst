Lab 5 - Threat Modeling
=======================

Overview 
--------

In this assignment you are tasked with coming up with hypothetical
scenarios based on the documentation given to you for XYZCorp. Below you
will find a diagram of the network. Your job is to come up with **2** of
each of the following attacks from the kill chain totaling 8 attacks:

-  Access/C2

-  Pivot

-  Effect

-  Exfiltrate

There are limited details on the network since during OSINT we may not
be able to collect every single detail. It is also left vague, so you
donâ€™t have to worry about the details as much such as whether or not
there is a vulnerability in a version number of a particular piece of
software. For example, you could say that your access is gained through
a vulnerability in a web application. If you start to create ideas that
you think are less likely, you can supplement them with more assumptions
in the attack.

**XYZCorp Mission and Timeline**: To conduct timely business selling
products and services to its customers.

You also need to create **1** chain of your attacks mapped together.
Take an access and explain how it could be used in conjunction with a
pivot and effect. Explain why the access enables you to pivot where you
want to go to create the effect you want to create.

.. important:: Remember: Think like a hacker and be creative!

Example Attack: Phishing
------------------------

*(You cannot use this as one of your attacks)*

**Attack**: Access

**Attack Description**: Malicious user will attempt to gain access to
the network by sending phishing emails to users on the network. This
will result in low level user access to a domain connected system. In
rare circumstances a privileged user may be compromised.

**Assumption**: Users will click on a phish.

**Attack cost and effort**: Low, finding email addresses for a given
organization is not challenging. Creating a phishing email is not
difficult, anyone could do it. (Add in who is the actor you are
emulating, e.g. anyone, script kiddie, talented hacker, nation state
adversary, insider threat).

**Likelihood**: [Use scale of 1-5 with description] 5, High likelihood
of a phish being clicked on by a user.

**Result**: User level access to the system

**[IF ATTACK IS EFFECT OR EXFILTRATE] Impact**: (How does this impact
the organization in short and long term?
