=========================
Lab 7 - Metasploit Basics
=========================

Include a screenshot for each step along the way while exploiting the
system.

Overview 
--------

With data from scanning you can now attempt to exploit a system. Youâ€™ll
have to decipher the scan output, decide which exploits to use, and then
launch them against the system to get a shell.


.. important:: Target: 172.17.0.0/24 Local network (Docker Container)

.. warning:: DO NOT EXPLOIT ANY SYSTEM THAT IS NOT ON YOUR LOCAL DOCKER NETWORK

Command to start docker container:

::

    docker run -it tleemcjr/metasploitable2:latest sh -c "/bin/services.sh
    && bash"

Task 1
------

Start the docker container and rescan it with nmap. Document your
results with a screenshot.

Task 2
------

Find a suitable exploit for the system under test. Once you have decided
on an exploit set the options and launch it. Take a screenshot of the
options set and of you running the commands getuid/whoami, pwd, and
ifconfig through the newly attained shell from a successful exploit.

Task 3
------

Find a **second** suitable exploit for the system under test. Once you
have decided on an exploit set the options and launch it. Take a
screenshot of the options set and of you running the commands
getuid/whoami, pwd, and ifconfig through the newly attained shell from a
successful exploit.
