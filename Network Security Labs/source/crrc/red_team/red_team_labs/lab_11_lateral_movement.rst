=========================
Lab 11 - Lateral Movement
=========================

Overview 
=========

Your job for this lab will be to exploit 2 separate targets and move
laterally through those to the final target. This lab will be completed
in the IA lab. Document your process and the methods that you use that
you use to pivot through the various hosts. Use screenshots to show your
pivoting setup.

You should use a different technique for moving laterally through the
Windows host and Linux host. You can use the same final exploit shown in
the video.

          trouble exploiting it check out the eternal blue psexec modules in
